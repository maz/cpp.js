CPP.js is a simple C Preprocessor implemented in CoffeeScript. To see how to use it, look at the index.html file which gives an example.

Simple Usage:

cpp("<my-code-here>",{MY_MACROS_HERE:"Macros?!"}) => result

Not yet implemented:
	#line
	#pragma
	#define my_func(a,b)	(a+b)
	#include
	(probably more features that i'm forgetting)
